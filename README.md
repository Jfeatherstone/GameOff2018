# GameOff2018
My project for the Github Game Jam 2018

The idea for now is a 2D platformer where the player can switch between two characters which will have different abilities,
both of which will be need to be used to complete levels. At the moment, there will hopefully be enemies, but we'll see as
the game progresses.

The game is being written in C++17, using SFML as the framework for basic window/sound/etc. functions.

All art will be original and created on my piskel account linked below!

I'll do my best to upload screenshots once the game is in a state where it actually runs :/


# What we have so far:
 - A 3 dimensional linked list to organize our levels (NLLinkedList)
 
 - A Level parser that can read in data from level .txt files (LoadLevel & levels/)
